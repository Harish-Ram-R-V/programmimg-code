Question 3: Autonomous Crane Fabrication Unit

Scenario: You’re designing an Autonomous Crane Fabrication Unit for assembling crane parts
(e.g., "Boom", "Counterweight", "Cable", "Hook", "Base") in a construction yard. The unit uses:

    ●	Part Delivery System (Queue): Parts arrive via trucks and queue for fabrication.
    ●	Crane Task Manager (Stack): Robots stack parts in LIFO order for load balancing.
    ●	Assembly Storage Unit (Array): Finished cranes store in an array-based yard (size: 6 slots). If full, the oldest is deployed.
    ●	Repair and Upgrade Tracker (Linked Lists):
        ○	Faulty cranes go to a singly linked list.
        ○	Repaired cranes move to a doubly linked list for dual checks.
        ○	High-priority cranes cycle in a circular linked list for urgent upgrades.
